Create a multiplayer minesweeper GUI game that fulfill the follow architecture.

The Architecture
Server (server.py):

Input: Reads a JSON object from Standard Input (Piped) containing the IP and user count.
Output: Prints the randomly assigned Port Number to Standard Output immediately.
Logic: Waits for n clients (in the json object), then runs for one rounds. It handles disconnection if a user exits early.

Client (client.py):
Input: Accepts IP, Port, ID, and Name as Command Line Arguments.
Logic: Connects to the server, sends identity, handles user input for moves, and disconnects  if "exit" is typed. Show the final result .

The json object looks like the follow
{
    "ip_address": "",
    "users": n,
    "userids": []
}

The rule of the mineswepper is like this:
Players take turns.
In their round, they can do the two things.
First, they can pick a block and reveal it like normal minesweeper
If the block that revealed is not a mine. They get 1 points
If it is ,  minus 3 points.
Second, they can pick a block and tag it.
At the end of the game, the tag  that is correctly placed on the mine get 5 points.
